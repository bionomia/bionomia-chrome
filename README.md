bionomia-chrome
======================

Adjust Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) occurrence pages, eg [https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/477976412][1] to include links to ORCID accounts for those who collected or identified the specimen and links to published works that used the specimen data. Also adjust GBIF dataset pages eg [https://www.gbif.org/dataset/275319e1-f91c-406f-b239-62cb9d4185cb][2] to include a button linking to a page that shows a list of people who collected and identified specimens included in the dataset under view.
